# grug for C

This repository provides a C implementation of grug, including the frontend, interpreter backend, and bindings.

The library is packaged as a single grug.c + grug.h pair, and the recommended way to install grug into your project is to copy those source files into your own project. For now they are written as-is, but shortly into the future that file will be generated by a program as an amalgamated build. After that point, grug should also function in the non-amalgam form.

## Example
See the `examples/` directory for usage examples, `test/` for how testing is done. However, here is a super minimal example.

main.c
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <inttypes.h>

#include <grug.h>

// Game fns get direct access to the grug state / context from which they are called
// For example, in a system with co-routines, each fiber may have its own grug state.
void game_fn_print_string(struct grug_state* gst, GRUG_ID me_caller, const union grug_value args[]) {
    (void)gst;
    printf("Entity %" PRIu64 " said %s\n", me_caller, GRUG_GET_STRING(gst, args, 0));
}

int main(void) {
    // Default settings (libc malloc/free, mods dir in the cwd, etc)
    struct grug_init_settings settings = grug_default_settings();

    // gst "grug state" contains all of the grug library state
    struct grug_state* gst = grug_init(settings);

    // let grug know where to call the print_string game function
    grug_register_game_fn_void(gst, "print_string", game_fn_print_string);

    // Grab the "ID" of the Dog::on_spawn and Dog::on_bark functions
    // This is not a normal grug object id, but a special function id
    GRUG_ON_FN_ID on_spawn_fn_id = grug_get_fn_id(gst, "Dog", "on_spawn");
    GRUG_ON_FN_ID on_bark_fn_id = grug_get_fn_id(gst, "Dog", "on_bark");

    // your file object is simple a handle to the script, and isn't the script itself 
    GRUG_FILE_ID labrador_script = grug_get_script(gst, "animals/labrador-Dog.grug");

    // this is the object / entity ID of the dog
    GRUG_ID dog1 = 1;
    // The initialization of members might call game fns, so beware that creating an entity may call game fns
    // grug holds on to the id (dog1) so don't change it without re-creating the entity too.
    GRUG_ENTITY_ID dog1_entity = grug_create_entity(gst, labrador_script, dog1);
    // tell this dog that it has spawned into the world
    GRUG_CALL_ARGLESS_VOID(gst, on_spawn_fn_id, dog1_entity);
    
    GRUG_ID dog2 = 2;
    GRUG_ENTITY_ID dog2_entity = grug_create_entity(gst, labrador_script, dog2);
    GRUG_CALL_ARGLESS_VOID(gst, on_spawn_fn_id, dog2_entity);
    
    GRUG_CALL_VOID(gst, on_bark_fn_id, dog1_entity, GRUG_ARGS(GRUG_ARG_STRING("Woof")));
    GRUG_CALL_VOID(gst, on_bark_fn_id, dog2_entity, GRUG_ARGS(GRUG_ARG_STRING("Arf")));

    while(true) {
        // This reloads any script and resource changes, recompiling files if necessary
        // Since you got IDs instead of the actual structures, grug can update things behind the scenes
        // Note that this also re-inits entity members which may call game fns
        grug_update(gst);

        // Most games will want to know what scripts got updated
        size_t num_updates = grug_num_updates(gst);

        for(size_t i=0; i<num_updates; ++i) {
            GRUG_FILE_ID updated_file = grug_update_file(gst, i);
            if(updated_file == labrador_script) {
                // re-call on_spawn - since the members get reset upon reload.
                GRUG_CALL_ARGLESS_VOID(gst, on_spawn_fn_id, dog1_entity);
                GRUG_CALL_ARGLESS_VOID(gst, on_spawn_fn_id, dog2_entity);
                
                // call these functions again for demonstration
                GRUG_CALL_VOID(gst, on_bark_fn_id, dog1_entity, GRUG_ARGS(GRUG_ARG_STRING("Woof")));
                GRUG_CALL_VOID(gst, on_bark_fn_id, dog2_entity, GRUG_ARGS(GRUG_ARG_STRING("Arf")));
            }
        }
    }

    // Technically unreachable (oops) but this will also clean up all the scripts and entities
    grug_deinit(gst);
}
```

animals/labrador-Dog.grug
```py
on_bark(sound: string) {
    print_string(sound)

    # Print "arf" a second time
    if sound == "arf" {
        print_string(sound)
    }
}
```

## API feature requirements
- round-trip grug file -> tokens -> json -> tokens - > grug file
